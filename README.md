# React Testing Demo

This is a basic demo app I spent a couple hours building in order to learn about the basics of [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started), [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) and [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/).

You can run this app using the "npm start" command and you can run its test suite using the "npm test" command.

If you'd like to learn about the basics of Jest, React Testing Library and Enzyme I recommend you consult the docs I linked above, and/or watch the following tutorials:
